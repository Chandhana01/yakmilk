        <p id="what">This game is an external-facing version of my notes app, where I collect questions I've been asked, I've asked, or I'd like to ask. Its sole intention is to remove transactionality in conversation and bring out the more interesting and less spoken-about stories, especially in groups.</p>
        <p id="how">How to play: Someone picks a question. They answer it first, followed by the rest of the group in an anti-clockwise direction (don't question this, it must be done). The questions are open to creative interpretation. Milk is always a good addition to the game, Yak milk if you can get ahold of it.</p>
